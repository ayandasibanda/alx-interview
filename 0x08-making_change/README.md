## Tasks To Complete 🛠️

+ [x] 0. **Change comes from within** 💡<br/>
  [`0-making_change.py`](0-making_change.py) contains a module with a function that determines the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount `total` when given a pile of coins of different values. The function must meet the following requirements:
  + **Prototype:** `def makeChange(coins, total)`.
  + **Return:** Fewest number of coins needed to meet `total`.
    + If `total` is `0` or less, return `0`.
    + If `total` cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return `-1`.
  + **Parameters:**
    + `coins`: A list of the values of the coins in your possession.
    + The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than `0`.
    + You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list.
  + **Requirements:**
    + Your solution’s runtime will be evaluated in this task.
