# 0x03. Log Parsing Project

Welcome to the "0x03. Log Parsing" project! In this project, you will enhance your Python skills by learning to parse and process data streams in real-time. The task involves reading data from standard input (stdin), handling it in a specified format, and performing calculations based on the input.

## Key Concepts

### File I/O in Python
- **Goal**: Learn how to read data from `sys.stdin` line by line.
- **Helpful Resource**:
  - [Python Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

### Signal Handling in Python
- **Goal**: Manage keyboard interruptions (such as CTRL + C) using signal handling.
- **Helpful Resource**:
  - [Python Signal Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)

### Data Processing
- **Goals**:
  - Extract specific data points from strings.
  - Summarize aggregated data.

### Regular Expressions
- **Goal**: Utilize regular expressions to check the format of each line.
- **Helpful Resource**:
  - [Python Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

### Dictionaries in Python
- **Goal**: Use dictionaries to track status code occurrences and accumulate file sizes.
- **Helpful Resource**:
  - [Python Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

### Exception Handling
- **Goal**: Handle potential exceptions during file reading and data processing.
- **Helpful Resource**:
  - [Python Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
